"""Runs WriteTasks and the step device→host staging pool.

The manager owns request/slot identity and when to submit. This class
owns the staging pool, the GPU-byte budget, the copy queues, and the
single committer that writes into the CPU block pool.

Two device→host paths — the step path does not write `chunk.host` in
the committer:

    JOIN_NEXT_STEP   save already launched a whole-step device→host into
                     a staging slot and set `chunk.host` as views.
                     Committer waits that `step_d2h_event`, then writes
                     the pool.
    JOIN_ON_FINISH   committer copies the device clone → owned host
                     tensors, then writes the pool.

Async: high-priority then low-priority queues, then pool write.
Eager: submit() does wait+write inline (CPU tests / no CUDA).
